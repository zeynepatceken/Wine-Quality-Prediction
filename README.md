## About the Project
This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of red wines. The goal is to analyze the effects of chemical compositions and other characteristics on the quality of the wines.

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009). It includes various features of the wines (pH, alcohol content, acidity, etc.) and their quality scores.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Modeling Process
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning missing values and preprocessing the data.
2. **Model Selection**: Choosing different machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest).
3. **Cross-Validation**: Evaluating the performance of models using cross-validation.
4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Determining the best parameters using GridSearchCV.
5. **Results Analysis**: Evaluating model performance and visualizing the results.




**Not**: This project is a practice project that I worked on individually after taking courses in data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence during my undergraduate computer engineering education.
